# bigredrobot

# To make life easier, after you clone the repo on to your computer and run catkin_make in the bigredrobot directory, type: source /devel/setup.bash
# You will need to do this in every terminal window to enable ROS autocompletes

# Alternatively type the following from /bigredrobot dir:

# a=$(readlink -f devel/setup.bash)
# echo "source "$a >> /home/cs4752/.bashrc

# And it should work on every terminal window you open
