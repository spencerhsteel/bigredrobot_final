# bigredrobot_final

Things to test:
    - Block stacking (all of it, particularly end conditions)
    - Switching between modes
    - Defense visual servo
    - Make throwing on target / faster / better
    - Left arm stuff
    
Things to calibrate:
    - Overhead camera arena bounds
    - Attack/defense/throw positions
    

SWITCHES:
    - game.py TEST_DEBUG = False
    - main.py CALIBRATE = False
    * robot\_interface.py USE_PARAMS = False
    - uncomment lines in main to actually check game phase from game instance
